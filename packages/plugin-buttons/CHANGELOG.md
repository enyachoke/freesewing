# Change log for: @freesewing/plugin-buttons


## 2.7.0 (2020-07-12)

### Changed

 - Snippet names are changed, `snap-male` is now `snap-stud` and `snap-female` is now `snap-socket` Changing this to avoid needless use of gender related terminology.

### Removed

 - Snippet `snap-male` and `snap-female` are no longer available. Use `snap-stud` and `snap-socket` instead

## 2.0.0 (2019-08-25)

### Added

 - Initial release


This is the **initial release**, and the start of this change log.

> Prior to version 2, FreeSewing was not a JavaScript project.
> As such, that history is out of scope for this change log.
